In these hard times, we should be all together. I'm so honored and so excited to be part of a team of really nice and strong people who come together to stand up against the current situation which is demanding and forcefull. 

This is a team of designers, developers and managers who come together to produce a tool to let people share their experience with others. They are building a website and apps which allows people to check out emergency situations and to help others who are in need and therefore find medical facilities around them and do some minor diagnostics as well. 

So thrilled to be part of them as a developer, aside from a really rich experience of being part of a large scale app as such and be in touch with colleagues and coworkers who are helping each other out, I'm learning how to be patient and to work together. As a iOS developer this is a life time opportunity. I'm telling you!!
